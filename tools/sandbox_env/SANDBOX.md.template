# Sandbox: {feature_name}

This is an isolated Amplifier workspace for developing the **{feature_name}** feature.

## Sandbox Information

- **Feature Name**: {feature_name}
- **Git URL**: {git_url}
- **Branch**: {branch_name}
- **Created**: {created_at}
- **Sandbox Directory**: {sandbox_dir}

## What is this?

This sandbox is a complete, isolated Amplifier workspace created for concurrent feature development. It exists to prevent context poisoning and provide security isolation through Docker containerization.

## Working in This Sandbox

### Start Development

```bash
cd {sandbox_dir}
source .venv/bin/activate
claude
```

### Project Location

Your project is at: `{project_name}/`

All your changes should be on the `{branch_name}` branch.

### Commit Your Work

```bash
cd {project_name}
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push -u origin {branch_name}
```

### Exit and Clean Up

When your feature is complete:

```bash
# Push your changes
cd {project_name}
git push origin {branch_name}

# Create pull request (optional)
gh pr create --title "{feature_name}" --body "Feature description..."

# Exit the sandbox
exit  # or Ctrl+D from Claude

# Remove the sandbox (from container)
cd /workspace
make sandbox-rm {feature_name}
```

## Important Notes

### Context Isolation

This Claude session knows nothing about other sandboxes. This is intentional to prevent context contamination. Each feature gets a fresh perspective.

### Temporary Nature

Sandboxes are temporary. Your git commits are permanent, but this workspace can be deleted once the feature is merged.

### Resource Limits

This sandbox runs in a Docker container with:
- 4 CPU cores maximum
- 8GB RAM maximum
- 50GB disk space maximum

### Security

The Docker container provides basic isolation from your host machine. This protects against:
- Runaway processes
- Accidental file operations
- Basic prompt injection attacks

However, sophisticated attacks could still escape. Review generated code before committing.
